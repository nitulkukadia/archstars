Consistency: All data across all nodes in a distributed system is the same.

Availability: Every request made to the database receives a response, even if some nodes are unreachable.

Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate even if network partitions occur, adversely affecting nodes and creating isolations.


According to the theorem,
  a distributed system must choose between consistency and availability depending on the presence of network partitions.
  This means that under network partitions, the system can either sacrifice consistency to maintain availability or sacrifice availability to maintain consistency.


Some Database Sysem can offer consistency with the performance cose long with Availability
